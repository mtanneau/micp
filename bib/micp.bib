  abstract  = {We present a unifying framework for generating extended formulations for the polyhedral outer approximations used in algorithms for mixed-integer convex programming (MICP). Extended formulations lead to fewer iterations of outer approximation algorithms and generally faster solution times. First, we observe that all MICP instances from the MINLPLIB2 benchmark library are conic representable with standard symmetric and nonsymmetric cones. Conic reformulations are shown to be effective extended formulations themselves because they encode separability structure. For mixed-integer conic-representable problems, we provide the first outer approximation algorithm with finite-time convergence guarantees, opening a path for the use of conic solvers for continuous relaxations. We then connect the popular modeling framework of disciplined convex programming (DCP) to the existence of extended formulations independent of conic representability. We present evidence that our approach can yield significant gains in practice, with the solution of a number of open instances from the MINLPLIB2 benchmark library.},

  abstract  = {Generalizing both mixed-integer linear optimization and convex optimization, mixed-integer convex optimization possesses broad modeling power but has seen relatively few advances in general-purpose solvers in recent years. In this paper, we intend to provide a broadly accessible introduction to our recent work in developing algorithms and software for this problem class. Our approach is based on constructing polyhedral outer approximations of the convex constraints, resulting in a global solution by solving a finite number of mixed-integer linear and continuous convex subproblems. The key advance we present is to strengthen the polyhedral approximations by constructing them in a higher-dimensional space. In order to automate this extended formulation we rely on the algebraic modeling technique of disciplined convex programming (DCP), and for generality and ease of implementation we use conic representations of the convex constraints. Although our framework requires a manual translation of existing models into DCP form, after performing this transformation on the MINLPLIB2 benchmark library we were able to solve a number of unsolved instances and on many other instances achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art solvers like Bonmin, SCIP, and Artelys Knitro.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we consider the use of extended formulations in LP-based algorithms for mixed integer conic quadratic programming (MICQP). Extended formulations have been used by Vielma et al. (INFORMS J Comput 20: 438--450, 2008) and Hijazi et al. (Comput Optim Appl 52: 537--558, 2012) to construct algorithms for MICQP that can provide a significant computational advantage. The first approach is based on an extended or lifted polyhedral relaxation of the Lorentz cone by Ben-Tal and Nemirovski (Math Oper Res 26(2): 193--205 2001) that is extremely economical, but whose approximation quality cannot be iteratively improved. The second is based on a lifted polyhedral relaxation of the euclidean ball that can be constructed using techniques introduced by Tawarmalani and Sahinidis (Math Programm 103(2): 225--249, 2005). This relaxation is less economical, but its approximation quality can be iteratively improved. Unfortunately, while the approach of Vielma, Ahmed and Nemhauser is applicable for general MICQP problems, the approach of Hijazi, Bonami and Ouorou can only be used for MICQP problems with convex quadratic constraints. In this paper we show how a homogenization procedure can be combined with the technique by Tawarmalani and Sahinidis to adapt the extended formulation used by Hijazi, Bonami and Ouorou to a class of conic mixed integer programming problems that include general MICQP problems. We then compare the effectiveness of this new extended formulation against traditional and extended formulation-based algorithms for MICQP. We find that this new formulation can be used to improve various LP-based algorithms. In particular, the formulation provides an easy-to-implement procedure that, in our benchmarks, significantly improved the performance of commercial MICQP solvers.},

  abstract = {A conic integer program is an integer programming problem with conic constraints. Many problems in finance, engineering, statistical learning, and probabilistic optimization are modeled using conic constraints. Here we study mixed-integer sets defined by second-order conic constraints. We introduce general-purpose cuts for conic mixed-integer programming based on polyhedral conic substructures of second-order conic sets. These cuts can be readily incorporated in branch-and-bound algorithms that solve either second-order conic programming or linear programming relaxations of conic integer programs at the nodes of the branch-and-bound tree. Central to our approach is a reformulation of the second-order conic constraints with polyhedral second-order conic constraints in a higher dimensional space. In this representation the cuts we develop are linear, even though they are nonlinear in the original space of variables. This feature leads to a computationally efficient implementation of nonlinear cuts for conic mixed-integer programming. The reformulation also allows the use of polyhedral methods for conic integer programming. We report computational results on solving unstructured second-order conic mixed-integer problems as well as mean--variance capital budgeting problems and least-squares estimation problems with binary inputs. Our computational experiments show that conic mixed-integer rounding cuts are very effective in reducing the integrality gap of continuous relaxations of conic mixed-integer programs and, hence, improving their solvability.},

  abstract  = { The branch and bound principle has long been established as an effective computational tool for solving mixed integer linear programming problems. This paper investigates the computational feasibility of branch and bound methods in solving convex nonlinear integer programming problems. The efficiency of a branch and bound method often depends on the rules used for selecting the branching variables and branching nodes. Among others, the concepts of pseudo-costs and estimations are implemented in selecting these parameters. Since the efficiency of the algorithm also depends on how fast an upper bound on the objective minimum is attained, heuristic rules are developed to locate an integer feasible solution to provide an upper bound. The different criteria for selecting branching variables, branching nodes, and heuristics form a total of 27 branch and bound strategies. These strategies are computationally tested and the empirical results are presented. },

  abstract = {This paper is motivated by the fact that mixed integer nonlinear programming is an important and difficult area for which there is a need for developing new methods and software for solving large-scale problems. Moreover, both fundamental building blocks, namely mixed integer linear programming and nonlinear programming, have seen considerable and steady progress in recent years. Wishing to exploit expertise in these areas as well as on previous work in mixed integer nonlinear programming, this work represents the first step in an ongoing and ambitious project within an open-source environment. COIN-OR is our chosen environment for the development of the optimization software. A class of hybrid algorithms, of which branch-and-bound and polyhedral outer approximation are the two extreme cases, are proposed and implemented. Computational results that demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework are reported. Both the library of mixed integer nonlinear problems that exhibit convex continuous relaxations, on which the experiments are carried out, and a version of the software used are publicly available.},

In this paper, we investigate a generic branch-and-bound framework for solving such problems. We first show that strict duality of the semidefinite relaxations is inherited to the subproblems. Then solver components such as dual fixing, branching rules, and primal heuristics are presented. We show the applicability of an implementation of the proposed methods on three kinds of problems. The results show the positive computational impact of the different solver components, depending on the semidefinite programming solver used. This demonstrates that practically relevant MISDPs can successfully be solved using a general purpose solver. },

  abstract  = {In this thesis, we study mixed-integer convex optimization, or mixed-integer convex programming (MICP), the class of optimization problems where one seeks to minimize a convex objective function subject to convex constraints and integrality restrictions on a subset of the variables. We focus on two broad and complementary questions on MICP. The first question we address is, "what are efficient methods for solving MICP problems?" The methodology we develop is based on outer approximation, which allows us, for example, to reduce MICP to a sequence of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems. By viewing MICP from the conic perspective of modern convex optimization as defined by Ben-Tal and Nemirovski, we obtain significant computational advances over the state of the art, e.g., by automating extended formulations by using disciplined convex programming. We develop the first finite-time outer approximation methods for problems in general mixed-integer conic form (which includes mixed-integer second-order-cone programming and mixed-integer semidefinite programming) and implement them in an open-source solver, Pajarito, obtaining competitive performance with the state of the art. The second question we address is, "which nonconvex constraints can be modeled with MICP?" This question is important for understanding both the modeling power gained in generalizing from MILP to MICP and the potential applicability of MICP to nonconvex optimization problems that may not be naturally represented with integer variables. Among our contributions, we completely characterize the case where the number of integer assignments is bounded (e.g., mixed-binary), and to address the more general case we develop the concept of "rationally unbounded" convex sets. We show that under this natural restriction, the projections of MICP feasible sets are well behaved and can be completely characterized in some settings.},

Linearity of the integer (or discrete) variables, and convexity of the nonlinear functions involving continuous variables are the main features in the underlying mathematical structure. Based on principles of decomposition, outer-approximation and relaxation, the proposed algorithm effectively exploits the structure of the problems, and consists of solving an alternating finite sequence of nonlinear programming subproblems and relaxed versions of a mixed-integer linear master program. Convergence and optimality properties of the algorithm are presented, as well as a general discussion on its implementation. Numerical results are reported for several example problems to illustrate the potential of the proposed algorithm for programs in the class addressed in this paper.
